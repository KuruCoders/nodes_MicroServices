This 📁repository was 🏗️created with the goal of attaining a foundational understanding of the migration from 🏛️monolithic to 🚀microservices architecture using NodeJs. This encompassess basic microservices. The 🖼️above diagram vividly illustrates the distributed nature of the architecture. Communication among services is seamlessly established through HTTP calls, fostering a dynamic and interconnected system. Below is an extensive list of the services included in this architectural exploration. 🌐

| Service | Value     | Description                |
